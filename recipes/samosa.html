      A samosa from the Persian word sambosag (meaning 'triangular pastry') is a fried South Asian and West
      Asian snack. It is a pastry with a savory filling, mostly vegetables, spiced potatoes, onions, and peas, but also
      meat or fish. It is made in different shapes, including triangular, cone, or crescent, depending on the
